# Increased Education Level of Women Associates with Higher Occupational Prestige and Happiness

This repository contains data and code used to produce a paper that analyzes the correlation between highest education level, occupational prestige and happiness in American women in a 20 year period, using data from the American GSS.

The `inputs` folder contains all the raw data from 20 years of GSS surveys ranging from 2000 - 2021.

The `scripts` folder contains 4 scripts:

- The first script simulates the data we are trying to derive.
- The second script downloads the data locally.
- The third script cleans the data and zeroes in on the aspects we are concerned with.
- The fourth script tests the clean data for validity.
  
The `outputs` folder has 2 subfolders:

- The data folder contains the csv's of the cleaned data from the data cleaning script.
- The paper folder contains the quarto document used to produce the final paper. Additionally, there are 8 images from a survey we created to supplement our arguement. The survey itself can be found at: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWJOvpPIAasEcq2d3Pj_F9eDsKonJB-4g5_HEet3xDaP4TVA/viewform
